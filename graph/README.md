# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Graphs are non-linear data structure that consist of a set of nodes that are connected by edges.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
- add node

Arguments: value


Returns: The added node


Add a node to the graph
- add edge

Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)

Returns: nothing

Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph

If specified, assign a weight to the edge

Both nodes should already be in the Graph

- get nodes
Arguments: none

Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

- get neighbors

Arguments: node

Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node

Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
- size

Arguments: none

Returns the total number of nodes in the graph


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Big O Notation for all methods:

- add node:
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
  - Space Complexity: O(1)

- add edge:
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
  - Space Complexity: O(1)

- get nodes:
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
  - Space Complexity: O(1)

- get neighbors:
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
  - Space Complexity: O(1)

- size:
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
  - Space Complexity: O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->
- add_node(): adds a node to the graph.
- add_edge(): adds an edge to connect two nodes within a graph.
- get nodes(): returns all nodes within the graph.
- get neighbors(): returns all the connected nodes for the passed node.
- size(): returns the number of the nodes within the graph
