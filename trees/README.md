# Trees
#### Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node
the left child node, and the right child node.
#### Binary Tree
Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
- pre order
- in order
- post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
#### Binary Search Tree
Create a Binary Search Tree class -This class should be a subclass (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
- Add
Arguments: value
Return: nothing
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- Contains
Argument: value -Returns: boolean indicating whether the value is in the tree at least once.
## Challenge
Create a Binary Tree class with these methods :
- pre-order
- in-order
- post-order
Create a subclass form binary Tree class called BinarySearchTree with these methods:
- add : add node into tree maybe in the left or in the right
- contain : return true if the tree contain the value , False if the tree does not contain
## Approach & Efficiency
### Big o notation
#### Time complexity :
- pre-order : o(n)
- in-order : o(n)
- post-order : o(n)
- add : O(log2n)
- contain : O(log2n)
#### space complexity :
- pre-order : o(n)
- in-order : o(n)
- post-order : o(n)
- add : O(n)
- contain : O(1)
## API
### add:
- check if the root is none if yes
- create a new node with the value
- iterate through the tree
- check if the valus that i have to add is greater than the root value then add it into the right
if it is less than the root add into left
- repeat the Process to add the elements that you want
### contain :
- iterate through the tree
using while loop
- check if the value is greate than the root that mean we need to ignore the left part
- check if the value is less than the root that mean we need to ignore the right part
and repeat the process until finding the value
- return True if the value is in tree
- return False if the value is not in tree
